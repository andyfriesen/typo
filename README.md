# Typo

A TypeScript compiler implemented in Rust.

I'm bothering to tinker with this for 3 reasons:

1. I think TypeScript is promising.
2. I think it's ridiculous to implement a compiler in JS.  Even if you can get past the correctness problems you embrace whenever you touch a dynamic language, the performance is awful.
3. I'm interested in Rust and need some flimsy excuse to use it to do something.

# Status

Not very far.
